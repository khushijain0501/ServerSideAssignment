        Devi Ahilya University, Indore has been a leading University of central
        India. The University within the framework of its UTD opened
        aself-financing engineering Institute namedInstitute of Engineering &

        on04 September 1996. It has been popularly known as IET-DAVV.<br><br>
        IET was started with a total intake of 90 students in three branches of Bachelor
        of Engineering (BE) - Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering and
        Electronics & Instrumentation Engineering having 30 students each. The
        first batch of these 90 students started their engineering career while
        studying in the classrooms of the sister UTD- School of Computer Science
        (SCS) and had got initially financial support from the other UTD-
        International Institute of Professional Studies (IIPS).<br><br>
        It is an approved Institution by All India Council for Technical Education
        (AICTE), New Delhi, Government of Madhya Pradesh and University Grants
        Commission (UGC). IET is academically autonomous with flexible and
        modern curriculum in all branches of engineering. It is fully
        self-financing Institute offering BE programmes in six branches.
        Recently, AICTE has approved 180 additional seats making total intake of
        540 students per year.<br><br>
        IET became PG Institute in 2002 and presently it
